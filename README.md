# Baseball Salary Project

## Description and Goals of the Project

- We chose this topic because we all shared an interest in both sport and finance and one question that combined our interest was the salary of athletes. We then narrowed that down to the sport of Baseball and specifically hitters because unlike their pitching counterparts play almost everyday and are almost always the highest players on the team. Once we got to the point, we wanted to look at our dataset, which gave us salaries from 1985-2015, and so we wanted to focus on a particular period which we chose the years of 2009-2014 as our training data and 2015 as our testing data. 


- We want to answer the question, "Based on the hitting performance of a player, what should their salary be?". We will be able to also look at the additional questions of, "Based on their actual salary for 2015, was this player overpaid or underpaid?, and "what teams were the most successful at avoiding overpaying players, and who had the most players who were overpaid?". This could lead to additional analysis on how these teams fared according to wins and losses.

## Description of the Dataset

- We pulled our Data from the Lahman's Baseball Datasets on [SeanLahman.com](https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). This website has baseball data from 1871-2021. This information had the hitting statistics were are using from 2009-2015 and the salary data from 2009-2015 as well. The hitting dataset had 22 columns and the salary dataset had 5 columns. They both shared two IDs which we could choose to merge on, we chose to use the player_id column as they held unique IDs for each player in the dataset.

### Communication Procedures
- We are using the Slack platform for most of our communication. We are keeping in contact on a daily basis on progress, posting updates, and discussing any questions. We are also working through sharing on Google to work on documents collaboratively and using the classroom hours between 7-9 PM on Monday and Wednesdays to assign tasks for the week.
