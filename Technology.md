# Technologies Used 

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will work in pandas ulitizing jupyter notebooks to extract the data from our database and perform additional analysis. We will mix the power of pandas and python to create additional features and filters for our project. The original dataset for batting has 22 columns, but there are  more stats that we could create mathematically to enhance our machine learning models. We will look to use the sklearn packages to either standardize or normalize the data as we get closer to running the model and once we can fully see what the datapoints are showing our team.

## Database Storage
We will use pgadmin to store our database. In our Conda environment we will use Flask and psycopg2 so that our database can interact with python. This will allow us to host the data in  web application where someone could filter for the hitting stats or salary of a certain player or certain years.
